  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 18, 2025</p>

  <p>Thank you for using <strong>ShareItSaveIt</strong> ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your data.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>ShareItSaveIt is designed to bookmark and organize social media URLs.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All data is stored locally on your device.</li>
    <li>The app does not use analytics or crash-reporting SDKs.</li>
    <li>No account or login is required.</li>
    <li>We do not collect your name, email address, or any personal identifiers.</li>
    <li>We do not operate servers for this app, and we do not receive your saved data.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Your device or Apple’s backup services may back up app data as part of normal device backups. This is handled by Apple and governed by Apple’s own policies.</p>

  <h2>2. How Your Data Is Used</h2>
  <p>Your bookmarked URLs and related information are used only inside the app to show and organize your saved content. We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The app may open external websites or apps (for example, social media or video platforms) when you open a saved link. These third-party services are governed by their own privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your data is stored only on your device.</li>
    <li>We do not sync or store your data on our own servers.</li>
    <li>We recommend using your device’s built-in security (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID) to help protect your data.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>While we aim to provide a secure app, no software is completely free of risk.</p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>ShareItSaveIt is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.</p>
