  <h1>ShareItSaveIt – Support</h1>

  <p>Thanks for using <strong>ShareItSaveIt</strong>! This app stores all data locally on your device and does not use servers, analytics, or cloud syncing. If you need help, you can reach out using the information below.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>Email: your-support-email@example.com</p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h3>Where is my data stored?</h3>
  <p>All saved links, folders, and notes are stored only on your device. No data is uploaded, collected, or synced to external servers.</p>

  <h3>If I delete the app, will my bookmarks be erased?</h3>
  <p>Yes. Since data is stored locally and not synced anywhere, uninstalling the app removes all saved links.</p>

  <h3>Can I restore my links after reinstalling the app?</h3>
  <p>Only if you restore your iPhone from a full device backup made before uninstalling the app. We cannot recover data for you because we do not run servers for this app.</p>

  <h3>The app crashed or froze. What should I do?</h3>
  <p>Try these steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Close and reopen the app.</li>
    <li>Restart your iPhone.</li>
    <li>Update to the latest version of iOS.</li>
    <li>Update ShareItSaveIt to the latest version from the App Store.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If the issue continues, email us with the details so we can investigate.</p>
